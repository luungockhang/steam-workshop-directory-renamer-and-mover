Hello, have you ever encountered a case where you want rename the Steam Workshop folders to their name in the Community Workshop menu, instead of an arbitrary ID?
You can use these scripts to do that.

WARNING: DO NOT USE THE ONES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN USE, IT MIGHT MAKE STEAM UNABLE TO RECOGNIZE THEM. 
MAKE BACKUPS!

How to use it:

1. Run Renamer to rename all Steam workshop directories. 
ONLY DO THIS ON THE GAME/APPLICATION FOLDER THAT YOU NEED TO RENAME. Please don't point it on the parent Steam Workshop folder.
I won't take responsibility if you did...

2. Run Mover if you need to move the directories to a different destinated one.
